Coursera Projects 


These Data Science Projects are a combination between assignments, capstones and own projects that have been done during the studay jurney through Coursera courses. 

## Projects: 

#### Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods
  This project is aiming to analyze the neighborhoods of two cities and group them into similar clusters to find out the similar amenities of neighborhoods. By using web scrapping and Foursquare API as data sources. And Python Data Science libraries to analyze and predict data.

#### Customer Category Prediction.
  This project will predict the customer membership category for a telecommunication provider. I used Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib for analysis purposes, and Sklearn library for classifier machine learning modeling.

#### Loan Status Prediction
  In this project I was aiming to find the most accurate ML classifier algorithm which will predict the Loan Status for new or unknown users. I used KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression classifier. 

#### Visualization Project.
  In this project I used two datasets to practice the visualization as I analyzed a survey dataset for Data Science topics and one for the crimes in San Francisco. I used the Matplotlib and Folium libraries to do the visualization.
